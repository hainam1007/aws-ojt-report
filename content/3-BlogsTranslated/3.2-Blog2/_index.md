# Accelerate your AWS migration with AWS Training and Certification

*Based on the blog by Srividhya Pallay, Chloe Gorgen, and Justin Lin (09 APR 2025).*

## 1. Why migration needs more than just technology

Moving workloads to **AWS Cloud** is a chance to:

- Improve performance and resilience  
- Reduce infrastructure costs  
- Enable long‑term innovation

But many migrations fail or stall not because of tools, but because of:

- Misalignment among senior leaders  
- Vague or shifting migration goals  
- Teams that are unfamiliar with operating on the cloud

Organizations that migrate successfully tend to have:

1. **Unified senior leadership** with clear direction and expectations.  
2. **Concrete migration goals**, timelines, and next steps.  
3. **Top‑down investment in training**, so people are confident working in the cloud.

**AWS Training and Certification** provides targeted learning paths for each phase of a migration to build that confidence.

## 2. Assess phase – understanding where you are

All migrations start with a deep look at the **current IT portfolio**:

- Applications and workloads  
- Data stores and integrations  
- Business goals, technical constraints, and current costs

During this phase, organizations must:

- Choose appropriate migration strategies (from lift‑and‑shift to full refactor).  
- Identify pain points and risks.  
- Estimate cost and potential savings in the cloud.

### 2.1 Typical challenges

- Limited awareness of the **200+ AWS services** available for the target architecture.  
- Lack of agreement on the overall migration approach.  
- Poor visibility into dependencies between legacy systems.

### 2.2 Helpful training resources

- **AWS Technical Essentials**  
  - Introductory course for technical teams.  
  - Covers core AWS services and architectures to help envision the target state.

- **AWS Cloud Essentials for Business Leaders**  
  - Free course for executives, IT leaders, and LOB managers.  
  - Builds a common understanding of cloud value, risks, and migration options.

With both technical and business‑oriented training, organizations can perform a more thorough and realistic assessment.

## 3. Mobilize phase – getting ready to move

Once the assessment is complete, the focus shifts to **preparing people and environments** for migration.

### 3.1 Key activities

- Form a **core migration team** to coordinate efforts.  
- Build a **comprehensive migration plan** with milestones and deliverables.  
- Set up the **AWS landing zone** with secure networking, identity, and governance.  
- Run **pilot migrations** to validate tools, processes, and assumptions.

### 3.2 Common roadblocks

- Limited hands‑on experience with AWS migration tools.  
- Uncertainty about how to configure a secure and scalable cloud environment.

### 3.3 Training to support mobilization

- **AWS Migration Essentials**  
  - Teaches how to discover, plan, execute, and track migrations  
    using services like AWS Application Migration Service, AWS DMS, and AWS Migration Hub.  
  - Designed for stakeholders across many roles.

- **Migration Foundations Knowledge Badge Readiness Path**  
  - Learning path for technical leaders.  
  - Combines courses, knowledge checks, two self‑paced labs, and an assessment to earn a badge.  
  - Focuses on simplifying and accelerating migrations using programs such as MAP and tools like Migration Evaluator.

## 4. Migrate and modernize phase – moving and improving workloads

In this phase, organizations **actually move** applications, workloads, and data.

### 4.1 Focus areas

- Use insights from pilot projects to **scale up** migrations.  
- Refine architectures to take advantage of:
  - Elastic scaling  
  - Managed databases  
  - Serverless services  
- Continuously monitor:
  - Performance and availability  
  - Cost and resource utilization  
  - Security posture and compliance

Migration is not a one‑time event. After initial cut‑over, teams can start **modernizing**:

- Breaking monoliths into microservices  
- Adopting serverless patterns  
- Tuning infrastructure to fully leverage the cloud model

### 4.2 Training for this phase

- **Approach to Mainframe Migration and Modernization**  
  - Free course introducing the value and methodology of moving mainframe workloads to AWS.  
  - Designed for a broad range of roles and experience levels.

- **Getting Started with AWS Mainframe Modernization Service**  
  - Free course for mainframe practitioners and administrators.  
  - Explains how to use AWS Mainframe Modernization to migrate and modernize critical applications.

## 5. Next steps – building a culture of continuous learning

To sustain success after migration, organizations need an **ongoing learning strategy**:

- Keep engineering teams up‑to‑date with new AWS capabilities.  
- Strengthen skills for operating, optimizing, and evolving cloud workloads.  
- Extend cloud literacy to finance, sales, and leadership.

Recommended resources include:

- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**  
  - Entry‑level certification that validates foundational AWS cloud concepts  
    for technical and non‑technical roles.  

- **AWS Skill Builder**  
  - Online training platform with 600+ free courses and learning plans.  
  - Team subscriptions help centralize learning programs for entire departments.

Organizations can also connect with an **AWS sales specialist** to:

- Plan migration roadmaps and target architectures.  
- Learn about programs like **Migration Acceleration Program (MAP)** and funding options.  

By combining structured training with the right programs and tools, teams can move from experimentation to a **confident, well‑governed cloud transformation**.
