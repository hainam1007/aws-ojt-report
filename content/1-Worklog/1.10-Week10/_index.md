### Week 10 Objectives:
* Change project into gitlab
* Configure CI/CD for project
* Discover how to translate continuously words with model AI

### Tasks carried out:

| Day | Task | Date | Status |
|-----|------|------|--------|
| Mon | - Find way that how to model can translate long video with a lot of gestures | 01/10/2025 | ✅ Done |
| Tue | - Change project from Github to Gitlab <br> - Learn how to use Gitlab <br> - Configure CI/CD | 01/11/2025 | ✅ Done |
| Wed | - Implement sliding window in be logic to translate continuously words | 01/12/2025 | ✅ Done |
| Thu | - Fix bugs and test web | 01/13/2025 | ✅ Done |
| Fri | - Implement paused-based segmentation in be | 01/14/2025 | ✅ Done |

### Achievements:
* ✅ Successfully configure CI/CD for gitlab to S3 and Cloudfront
* ✅ Implement two ways about translate continuous words into web
* ✅ Test accuracy of two ways

### Key Learnings:
* Gitlab CI/CD pipeline configuration
* Automated deployment to S3 and CloudFront
* AI model optimization for continuous translation
* Sliding window algorithm implementation
* Paused-based segmentation techniques

### Challenges:
* Gitlab CI/CD pipeline setup → Configured proper stages and deployment scripts
* Continuous translation accuracy → Implemented sliding window approach
* Model performance → Optimized with paused-based segmentation

### Next Week:
* Final Hackathon presentation
* Project documentation
* Performance optimization
